# Talent Fest LATAM Laboratoria
## Encora Team

Boost the number of job applications from women. Due to cultural and social barriers, it's difficult for many women to recognize their achievements and skills. In most Latin American cultures, we are taught from an early age to be humble. It plays against us when we need to look for new opportunities in the workplace. This project is a tool that helps women build their resumes via a series of questions. Users will answer several questions. Once they submit their answers, they get a document with a draft of their resume. It’ll also provide them a list of Encora resources available to them and open positions from Encora.
